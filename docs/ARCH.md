This diagram outlines the secure supply chain:

1. **Git Repo** – source code and configuration.
2. **CI/CD** – performs linting, testing and builds on every commit.
3. **SBOM** – Software Bill of Materials generated by Syft.
4. **Scans** – security scanning via Grype and Trivy.
5. **Build/Sign** – package is built and signed using Cosign.
6. **Artifacts** – resulting wheels and archives stored as release assets.
7. **Monitoring/Logging** – runtime monitoring with `monitor.py` and encrypted logs via `secure_logging.py`.
8. **Vault** – secrets such as signing keys and API tokens are retrieved from HashiCorp Vault.
9. **TPM** – hardware root of trust, used for key sealing and remote attestation.
10. **Release** – publish signed packages and SBOM.
